Slug position
=============

First possibility: example.com.51ug.wry.ly

  Requires that the slug be distinguishable from all top-level
  domains, which is easily accomplished by including numbers.

  Requires a redirect that may not reliably preserve document
  #fragments, and incurs additional network overhead.

Second possibility: example.com.wry.ly/path/to/resource#51ug

  Does not require a redirect; can be added dynamically by the
  injected script.

  Ambiguous behavior in case of existing fragment identifier.

  Idea: use existing identifier as conversation key. Concerns:

    Must existing identifiers become global conversation points?

    Can conversation keys still span multiple pages? Should they?

    How to distinguish first accessors from subsequent viewers?


Purpose of the system
=====================

Mimimalistic: support arbitrary user-defined fragment identifiers.

Conversations: socially networked, or topically siloed?
